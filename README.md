# portfolio-honours-class2
Modify the code of previous honours classification program (Making Decisions). 
1.	Create a function for determining the honours classification. The function accepts the weighted average mark and return the honours classification.
2.	Create a function to determine the congratulatory message. The function accepts the weighted average mark and return the congratulatory message. 

Summary:
After the user enters the first name, last name and weighted average mark, there are
two functions to decide the output of classification and congratulatory message
respectively. The third function get_result will exclude those who enter an invalid
weighted average mark which is out of range and the user will only get an error
message.

Self-reflection:
I learnt the application of multiple parameters in this exercise and I came across this
method on the web.
